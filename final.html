			<h3>Income inequality creates health inequality</h3>

			<p>The United States is suffering from inequality, and not just economically. Income inequality has increasingly become closely associated with a multitude of factors that profoundly affect the life expectancies of low-income Americans.</p>
			<div>
			<p>Poverty is one of the most important contributors to a lower life expectancy. Some communities such as racial minorities, people living in rural areas, and disabled people are more likely to be economically disadvantaged, which in turn can reduce their access to resources that are key to a healthy life and thus a higher life expectancy. Lifestyle and stress are also significant factors that can affect a personâ€™s life expectancy.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>Additionally, marginalized groups have unequal social and economic opportunities, which further increases income inequality. The increased risk of mental illness and chronic disease, as well as higher mortality, causes a lower life expectancy. Risk factors include smoking, cancer, heart disease and obesity.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>In recent years, COVID-19 has also become a part of the problem as it has a wide range of effects that affects people disproportionately according to their socioeconomic status. Income inequality and its relationship with health is a complex issue that requires government policy to reduce socioeconomic inequality.</p>
		</div>

			<h3>Data backs this finding</h3>
			<p>The gaps between the rich and the poor have not lessened, but have instead grown a lot over time. According to The Equality of Opportunity Project, the poorest Americans did not gain any years in longevity while the richest gained 3 years in the past decades. Life expectancy also varies according to the region, however, the location only has a notable effect on the life expectancies of poor people.</p>
			<div>
			<p>The Health Inequality Project is a research team that uses big data to measure differences in life expectancy by income in order to outline the full extent of the relation between health and income inequality in America. Their collected data shows the trends of life expectancy by gender and income quartile over time.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>In the state of New York from the year 2001 to 2014, the life expectancy increased for both males and females of the first and fourth income quartiles. However. despite the upwards trend, the discrepancy between them still persists. Women in the fourth income quartile continue to be the group with the highest life expectancy, while men in the first quartile continue to have the lowest life expectancy. In 2014, women in the fourth quartile are expected to live 10 years longer than men in the first quartile on average at 89.4 years and 79.28 years respectively. Although the specific number of years of the gap between genders and income levels fluctuate each year, it is obvious that the gap in the general trend of life expectancies have not improved, despite the numerous social and economic changes during the range of time of the dataset. The dataset is race-adjusted, which means that race was not a factor that was counted in the graph.</p>

			<p>When compared with some other countries, the United States also falls short. The research found that the estimated mean life expectancy for American women and men was less than other developed, first-world, world power countries in Europe and Asia. With the life expectancy for women at 82.48 years and 78.63 for men, the United States is outperformed by countries such as Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Australia. Compared to developed Asian countries like Japan and Singapore, America also has the lesser life expectancy for both gender categories. This is not proportionate with America's GDP and economic prosperity, which proves it is not a lack but rather unequal distribution of wealth that causes the health inequality of America.</p>

			<h3>Making changes is imperative</h3>
			<p>To sum up, the correlation between income inequality and gaps of life expectancy is supported by a lot of data. Poverty increases the risk of health issues and limits access to resources. As a result, the richest Americans live several years longer than the poorest ones, an inequality of life itself. To change this condition, it is necessary for policy changes on a national level.</p>
